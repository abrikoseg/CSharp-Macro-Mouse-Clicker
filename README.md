# C# Macro Mouse Clicker
I recently found myself playing [Fallen London](http://www.failbettergames.com/fallen-london/) and realised a macro mouse clicker would help expedite my progress in the venture. However none of the ones I came across in my Googlings were any good, and so I wrote my own. 

## Usage
Middle click anywhere to record a new mouse click. 

While a macro is not running:
* clicks can be deleted by selecting them and pressing the Delete key
* position, time to wait after clickking, and mouse button can be set by editing the grid
